I decided to write this project using NCURSES, a library that allows for fancy text-based rendering in the terminal.
You can either just copy the parts you want to run, or you can download NCURSES (Or PDCurses on windows!!!!) and link it in Visual Studio.
:)

Alternatively, you can just run the program here --> https://repl.it/@samvader/AP-FR-FrogSimulation#main.cpp
