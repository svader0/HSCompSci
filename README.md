# CompSci (BWAGNER) CS1 - IBHL2

This is my repository of computer science work from my 4 years in high school. We use [https://bwagner.org](bwagner.org) in school, and it's an excellent resource for anyone getting started with Java. This repository contains all of my solutions (good or horrendous) to the assignments on that site.
Some of my solutions are done in c++, but I'm trying to include Java versions (... and others, maybe?) as I progress through the course.
Feel free to open a pull request if you have any additional assignments or languages to add that are missing here.
