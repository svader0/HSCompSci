# CompSci (BWAGNER) CS1 - IBHL2

This is my repository of computer science work from my 4 years in high school. We use [https://bwagner.org](bwagner.org) in school, and it's an excellent resource for anyone getting started with Java. (You can complete the assignments in other languages as well. ;) ) This repository contains all of my solutions to the assignments on that site.
Some of my solutions are done in c++, but I'm trying to include Java versions (... and others, maybe?) as I progress through the course.
Feel free to open a pull request if you have any additional assignments or languages to add that are missing here.

Best regards,
Sam
